<h3 align="center">(A simple parser and lexer)</h3>

Hi! This project aims to be an educational implementation of a **Lexer Generator & Parser generator** following a Lex-like sintax to configure it. 

It uses a **Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA)** for Regex Patterns recognition. Down below, there will be more explanation about the actual pipeline the inputs suffer in order to recognize tokens.

## Getting Started ðŸŽ¬

```bash
task build                              // Builds YAAAlex app
task run <YALex file> <Output path>     // Runs YAAAlex with an definition file and and output file
task testLex <YALex file >              // Builds and compiles a lexer file, and run it with a dummy main.
task test                               // Run tests
task clean                              // Removes executables
```
